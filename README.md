# GPTZero Chat Plugin

### [Watch the Demo Video](https://clipchamp.com/watch/drcNWYD3Qqs)

GPTZero Chat Plugin predicts whether a given text was generated by a large language model. Once the plugin is installed and activated, you can use it in ChatGPT conversations. When a relevant question is asked, the model will invoke an API call to the GPTZero API. The model will incorporate API results in its response to the user.

## Requirements: You must purchase a GPTZero API Key

To use the GPTZero Chat Plugin, you must have a GPTZero API Key.

💸 Please note that using the GPTZero API incurs costs based on your subscription plan.

You can obtain an API key by following these steps:

1. Visit the GPTZero website at [https://app.gptzero.me/login](https://app.gptzero.me/login).
2. Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.
3. Choose a subscription plan that suits your needs. Be aware that the API key is a paid feature, and the cost will depend on the selected plan. Review the pricing details carefully to understand the associated costs.
4. View your API key at [https://app.gptzero.me/app/api](https://app.gptzero.me/app/api).

❗Keep your API key secure: It will be required during the installation process.
